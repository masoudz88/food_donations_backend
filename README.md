# food_donations_backend
* backend is written using nodejs and the express module, to read the data from __sqlite__ database as it is structured and easier to deal with and using express routes and responses, user is able to update or delete the rows in database
* To run the backend we need to run the command **node src/app.js**

# [food_ donation_frontend](https://github.com/masoudz88/food_donations_frontend/)
* This project is splitted to *two* parts so that I can concentrate more on each section. The [frontend repo](https://github.com/masoudz88/food_donations_frontend/) contains all react codes related to front end and communicates with backend using REST API.
# Running the Application
* Ensure you are using a modern node version
## Front end
* cd /waste-management-system
* npm install
* npm start
## Back end
* npm install
* node src/app.js

Open up http://localhost:3000/, the app should now be running!
