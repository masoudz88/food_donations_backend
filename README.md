# [food_ donation_frontend](https://github.com/masoudz88/food_donations_frontend/)
* This project is splitted to *two* parts so that I can concentrate more on each section. The [frontend repo](https://github.com/masoudz88/food_donations_frontend/) contains all react codes related to front end and communicates with backend using REST API.
